## Project Overview

### Introduction
This project is a small HTML application that leverages the TensorFlow Face Mash model. It aims to determine if a human is present in front of the monitor by performing validations based on eye movements and other facial gestures.

### Features
- **Human Detection**: Uses the TensorFlow Face Mash model to detect human presence.
- **Eye Movement Validation**: Checks for specific eye movements to confirm human presence.
- **Facial Gesture Analysis**: Analyzes other facial gestures to increase accuracy.

### How It Works
The system uses the TensorFlow Face Mash model to analyze the user's face in real-time. By tracking eye movements and other facial gestures, it can determine whether a human is in front of the monitor. This can be particularly useful for security applications or for ensuring user engagement.
